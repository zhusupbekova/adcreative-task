This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Alina's Journey in Tech

Hello! I'm Alina, a passionate software engineer with a diverse background and a knack for learning new languages and technologies.

## Early Days

At 17, I moved to China to pursue my studies. I spent two years mastering Chinese at South China University of Technology, achieving HSK 5, before transitioning to Guangzhou University for a Sino-French Tourism Management program. Realizing my true passion lay elsewhere, I left the program to embark on a new path in tech.

## Diving into Coding

In late 2019, I began my coding journey and joined Xanthous Tech by March 2020. My first project was a property listing website developed using Gatsby, GraphQL, and Strapi.

## Freelance Success

I thrived in freelance work, earning high praise and badges on UpWork for projects like:

- **K-12 Learning Platform for Arizona State University (July - September 2020)**: React, TypeScript, AntD, Prisma.
- **ClassAir for a Singaporean company (November 2020 - February 2021)**: NextJS, TypeScript, AntD, SWR, Vercel.
- **RAIA (May - November 2021)**: Trained a text-based automated ISA, later known as Ylopo AI, using NextJS and AntD.
- **Digital Coupon Platform (January - February 2022)**: Full-stack development with Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Strapi, Supabase.
- **AccioPay (April - July 2022)**: Developed a mobile-first web app for Singapore's card-free shopping platform for students using Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, SWR, MaterialUI.

## Continuous Learning

Between projects, I enhanced my skills through courses, tutorials, and personal projects like form endpoints for HTML forms.

## Mobile App Development

Venturing into mobile apps, I co-developed ForwardSMS, an SMS forwarding tool for Android, and explored iOS development, releasing:

- **Slippy (October 2023)**: A pocket money and chore management app for parents.
- **ScreenshotÂ° (January 2024)**: An app for organizing and searching screenshots by text and tags.
- **Lullatale (March 2024)**: A collection of children's stories with matching soundscapes.

## Current Endeavors

Currently, I am working on another iOS app, pushing my boundaries and honing my skills further.

## Personal Interests

Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, going to the gym, and learning languages. I speak Russian (native), English (fluent), Chinese, and Turkish (conversational), with a bit of French and Japanese.

## Conclusion

I'm excited to continue this journey, tackling new challenges and creating impactful solutions. Let's build something amazing together!
